                    <p>Right now is a fantastic time to be, or become, an OCaml programmer. In addition to rising interest in functional programming, static languages, and OCaml specifically, the language is seeing increasing application in industry as well. But what's more interesting is that several fantastic changes to the language are nearing readiness for use and are being considered for inclusion in the main branch of the OCaml compiler.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Multicore</h2>

                    <p>Unfortunately, OCaml's current multicore story is nothing to brag about. At the moment, the language has absolutely no support for <i>shared-memory</i> parallelism. A brief review of terminology for those who don't already know: parallelism is the phenomenon of executing instructions on two or more processors simultaneously. A parallel program is one that exhibits parallelism. This much, OCaml is capable of, though only in an inefficient way. OCaml's parallelism support comes in the form of <i>processes</i>. The reason processes are inefficient is because processes spawned by the same program do not have a shared memory space. This has two effects. First, in order for two simultaneously live processes to communicate, they must rely on <i>message passing</i>, which is a relatively slow, expensive operation. Second, as processes do not share memory, a new process must copy over all the data in memory (this is an over simplification, as the heap is copy-on-write, but the idea is there). Thus, forking late in the life of a program is a very slow process.</p>

                    <p>Shared-memory parallelism is a more efficient form of parallelism. As opposed to processes, which don't share, <i>system threads</i> share access to a single heap. This allows programmers to get around both weaknesses of processes. Threads can communicate without message passing by writing to shared objects on the heap. And as everything is shared, there is no need to copy over data. However, all these advantages come at a price. Programs which use shared-memory parallelism are infamously difficult to write correctly and debug. Reads and writes to shared variables must be synchronized using complicated and error-prone mechanisms such as semaphores, and invisible bugs are very easy to encode into your program. One thread might load the contents of a variable before a the other thread performs a write to that variable. The two threads now disagree about the contents about that variable, which will likely to lead to errors down the road. Such an issue is hard to debug because the issue is likely to manifest later in the execution of the program than where the error is first introduced. Further, the order of instruction execution in a parallel setting is not well-defined, so the error might manifest seemingly randomly.</p>

                    <p>So where does OCaml come in? About a decade ago, Xavier Leroy had the following to say about shared-memory parallelism:

                    <blockquote cite="http://mirror.ocamlcore.org/caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2002/11/64c14acb90cb14bedb2cacb73338fb15.en.html">
                    Shared-memory multiprocessors have never really "taken off", at least in the general public.  For large parallel computations, clusters (distributed-memory systems) are the norm. For desktop use, monoprocessors are plenty fast. Even if you have a 4-processor SMP machine, it isn't clear whether you should write your program using shared memory or using message passing -- the latter is slightly more expensive, but scales to clusters... 

                    What about hyperthreading?  Well, I believe it's <b>the last convulsive movement of SMP's corpse</b> :-)  We'll see how it goes market-wise.  At any rate, the speedups announced for hyperthreading in the Pentium 4 are below a factor of 1.5; probably not enough to offset the overhead of making the OCaml runtime system thread-safe.  

                    In summary: there is no SMP support in OCaml, and it is very very unlikely that there will ever be.  If you're into parallelism, better investigate message-passing interfaces.
                    </blockquote>

                    The emphasis is mine. Today, we know that Leroy was very wrong about SMP. Every commercial desktop, laptop, and smartphone is multi-core. Most programs don't <i>need</i> SMP, but it's absence is frequently cited as a major weakness of OCaml.

                    </p>

                    <p>Which is a shame quite frankly, because default-immutable, functional languages make shared-memory parallelism much easier. The root of parallel programming woes is that threads need coordinate with eachother if they both want to read to and write from a shared variable. Since a major goal of the functional paradigm is to eschew destructive writes as much as possible, functional programs don't need to bend over backwards to get around this issue. It's part of the plan in the first place. Additionally higher order functions represent a natural way to express parallel execution of a function. One can imagine a higher order function <code>async: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b</code> such that <code>async f x</code> produces the same value as <code>f x</code> but computes the result in a separate thread. If <code>f</code> is pure and <code>x</code> is not a mutable variable, then replacing calls to code <code>f x</code> with calls to <code>async f x</code> will not introduce parallelism errors.</p>

                    <p>The Cambridge-based OCaml Labs is currently working on an SMP-supporting branch of the language. The main challenge is writing a parallel-friendly garbage collector that is both correct and sufficiently performant. In particular, the high performance of the garbage collector in the sequential case is a major reason for using the language in the first place, so the team is working on a solution that preserves this performance as much as possible. Some have estimated that a working prototype should be around by the end of the year, and it may be some time before the implementation is sufficiently vetted to be recommendable for industry level usage. Even so, things are moving in the right direction.</p>
